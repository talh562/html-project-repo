        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Typically, IoT helps in advanced connectivity of devices,
                systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine
                (M2M) communications. IoT is mostly suitable for heart
                monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals,
                electric clams in coastal waters, automobiles with built-in
                sensors, devices for environmental/food/pathogen monitoring or
                field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and
                rescue operations. More number of people wants to avoid
                troublesome situations. In the modern world people wants more
                luxury, So IoT is mostly used in home automation (also known
                as smart home devices) such as the control and automation of
                lighting, heating (like smart thermostat), ventilation, air
                conditioning (HVAC) systems, and appliances such as
                washer/dryers, robotic vacuums, air purifiers, ovens or
                refrigerators/freezers that use Wi-Fi for remote monitoring. In
                the future hundreds of billions of physical devices which are
                embedded with smart sensors will interact with one another
                without human involvement, on a Machine-to-Machine basis.

            <h2 class="subheader">Transportation</h2>
            <p>The IoT can play the important role in integration of
                communications, control, and information processing across
                various transportation. Application of the IoT extends to all
                aspects of transportation systems (i.e. the vehicle and the driver
                or user). Dynamic interaction between these components of a
                transport system enables inter and intra vehicular
                communication, smart traffic control, smart parking,
                electronic, logistic and fleet management, vehicle control, and
                safety and road assistance. Modern automobiles are
                equipped with sensors which are connected to the internet
                through control systems. IoT plays important role in road 
                safety- systems. Such as collision detection, lane change warning, traffic signal control,
                intelligent traffic scheduling.

            <h2 class="subheader">Environmental Monitoring</h2>
            <p>The Environmental monitoring applications of the IoT typically
                use sensors to assist in environmental protection by monitoring
                the atmospheric situations.like monitoring the movements of
                wildlife and their habitats. The physical devices connected to
                the Internet which are used as warning systems can also be used
                by emergency services to provide more effective aid.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subheader">Medical and health care</h2>
            <p>IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and
                emergency notification systems. Some hospitals have begun
                implementing smart beds that can detect when they are
                occupied and when the patient is attempting to get up.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subheader">Home automation</h2>
            <p>Home automation is the residential extension of building
                automation. It involves the control and automation of lighting,
                heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and security, as
                well as home appliances such as washer/dryers, ovens or
                refrigerators/freezers. They use Wi-Fi for remote monitoring
                and are a part of the Internet of things.

            <p>By develop the agriculture machinery into smart devices causes
                control the water pumps and sprayers are controlled anywhere.
