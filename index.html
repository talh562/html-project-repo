            <p>The IoT concept was coined by a member of the Radio
                Frequency Identification (RFID) development community in
                1999, and it has recently become more relevant to the practical
                world largely because of the growth of mobile devices,
                embedded and ubiquitous communication, cloud computing
                and data analytics.<br></p>

                The internet of things (IoT) is the working of physical devices
                with the help of internet, physical devices which are embedded
                with sensors, electronics, softwareâ€™s and network connectivity
                that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. It was
                first introduced by Kelvin Ashton in the year 1998
